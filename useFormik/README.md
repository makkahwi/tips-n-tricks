# useFormik

How to build a dynamic useformik functionality based on a list on form inputs.

Instead of doing a redundant work of adding input components in form UI, and adding form initial values object, and form validation and errors generation object, we are sending an array of form inputs with each input details, and using this array, we auto generate UI of the form and formik object to validate the form.

## This part shows how to auto-generate

- Initial values
- form validation

## To Fix

- Replace components with html tags
- Add form UI rendered
- Add example of inputs lists and generated form with useformik
